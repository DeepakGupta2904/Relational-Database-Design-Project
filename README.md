# Relational-Database-Design-Project

In this project, I am work on converting a relational design that enlists various users, their roles, user accounts and their statuses into different tables in SQL Server and insert data into them. Having at least two rows in each of the tables, you have to ensure that you have created respective foreign keys.

Tools:- MS SQL Server

Tasks To Be Performed:-

1. Define relations/attributes 
2. Define primary keys
3. Create foreign keys

Download the AdventureWorks database from the following location and restore it in your server:

Location:- https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/adventureworks

File Name: AdventureWorks2012.bak

Adventureworks is s sample database shipped with SQL Server and it can be downloaded from the GitHub site. AdventureWorks has replaced Northwind and Pubs sample databases that were available in SQL Server in 2005. Microsoft keeps updating the sample database as it releases new versions.
